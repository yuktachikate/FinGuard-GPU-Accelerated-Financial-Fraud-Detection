# FinGuard: GPU-Accelerated Financial Fraud Detection
## Overview
FinGuard adapts NVIDIA’s innovative AI strategies—originally applied in telecommunications—to tackle a real-world finance challenge: credit card fraud detection. Leveraging GPU-accelerated deep learning in Google Colab, this project builds and trains a neural network on the publicly available Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. The solution is further extended with explainable AI, real-time fraud monitoring simulation, and provisions for integrating with streaming platforms like Apache Kafka.

## Motivation
Credit card fraud causes billions in losses each year. FinGuard demonstrates how advanced GPU-accelerated deep learning can rapidly and accurately detect fraudulent transactions. The project emphasizes interpretability and scalability, laying the groundwork for real-time fraud monitoring and broader financial applications.

## Project Structure
### Data Acquisition & Exploration:
Upload the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.
